# Output from CUPiD Example

After `cupid-diagnostics` runs successfully from `${CUPID_ROOT}/examples/regional_ocean`,
you will have four notebooks in the `computed_notebooks/ocn/` subdirectory.
We have included the expected output in this webpage as a reference,
but ideally you will be able to look at the notebooks you have run inside JupyterHub.

## Notebook Output

* [Regional Ocean Report Card with CUPiD](cupid_output/Regional_Ocean_Report_Card)
* [Regional Ocean Animations with CUPiD](cupid_output/Regional_Ocean_Animations)
* [Regional Ocean Atmospheric Forcing with CUPiD](cupid_output/Regional_Ocean_Atmospheric_Forcing)
* [Regional Ocean OBC with CUPiD](cupid_output/Regional_Ocean_OBC)
