CESM Setup 
===============

The first step in running an ocean model inside the CESM is setting up the CESM! Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Clone the repo
-------------------------
CROCODILE has its own fork of the CESM available here: https://github.com/CROCODILE-CESM/CESM. Go ahead and clone it as shown below. I'm gonna call mine CROCESM.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/CROCODILE-CESM/CESM CROCESM

Step 2: Checkout all the components
----------------------------------------
The original clone only clones the CESM code, we need to checkout all of the components as well, like the ocean model and the sea ice model. This will take some time.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd CROCESM
    ./bin/git-fleximod update

Step 3: Done!
----------------
We're done! Remember this path, and continue over to the :ref:`notebook_walkthrough`
