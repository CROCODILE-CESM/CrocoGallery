Input Parameters
==================

Diag_table, MOM_input, input.nml, etc are generated by default in MOM_interface, which is the CESM interface to MOM6. It can be found under components/mom in CESM sandboxes.
Generating the files in a case directory is done by calling preview_namelists, which does a lot more than previewing the namelists. It validates the parameters and then generates the files themselves. 
You can see the generated files in the case's CaseDocs directory. 

Overriding MOM_input can be done by adding to a case's user_nl_mom (MOM Namelists).
Overriding other files, like the diag_table can be done by adding the file to the case's SourceMods/src.mom directory with the same exact filename. A pretty standard and easy practice 
is to generate the default files using preview_namelists, then copy the files to SourceMods/src.mom, and then edit them as needed. It's one of the easiest ways to take advantage
of our recommended defaults while still being able to customize the files.
