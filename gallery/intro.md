# Welcome to the CrocoDash Gallery!


To get used to CrocoDash, we provide a set of tutorials, features, & use cases that showcase the basic and advanced features of the platform. These demos are designed to help you understand how to use CrocoDash effectively.
These demos are provided in the CrocoGallery, available here, on Github (https://github.com/CROCODILE-CESM/CrocoGallery), and as a submodule of CrocoDash in demos/gallery/notebooks
