# Welcome to the *in-progress* CrocoGallery! 🐊✨

Yes, it’s still a bit rough around the edges. Think of it like a baby crocodile: adorable, slightly scary, and learning to swim.  

CrocoGallery is a collection of notebook tutorials, features, and use cases for **CROCODILE** packages, hosted via **GitHub Pages** with **Jupyter Book**.  

Whether you’re just dipping your toes or diving headfirst into the deep end, these guided notebooks show off what CROCODILE can do for regional ocean modeling — and how to make it do the heavy lifting for you.

Start with the tutorials on the sidebar and explore at your own pace!
