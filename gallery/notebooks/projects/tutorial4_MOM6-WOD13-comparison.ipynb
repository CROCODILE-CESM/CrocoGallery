    "# Model-Observation comparison: comparing to the World Ocean Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to get familiar with the basics of using CrocoCamp to interpolate MOM6 output onto the space of observations stored in the World Ocean Database (WOD). For this tutorial we will use output from a MOM6 run already stored on NCAR's HPC system, and WOD13 observation files already in obs_sequence format and also stored on NCAR's HPC system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The configuration file\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpolate the model data onto the observation space, CrocoCamp needs to know where the model and observation data are. We can tell it by using a `config.yaml` configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by copying the template into a new file (e.g. in the command line and from this notebook's directory: `cp ../configs/config_template.yaml ../configs/config_my_tutorial_3.yaml`)\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use our favourite editor to modify the new file, making sure that the paths in the `INPUT FILES` section are as follows (note that the MOM6 files are the same as in tutorial 1, so those paths are identical between the two tutorials):"
