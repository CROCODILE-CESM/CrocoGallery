    "## Task 1: Clone CUPiD and Install Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "CUPiD is available from the NCAR organization on [github.com](https://github.com/NCAR/CUPiD).\n",
    "It requires conda to manage a few different python environments.\n",
    "On the NCAR super computer, you can run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module load conda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and use the version of conda managed by the system administrators.\n",
    "If you need to install conda on a different computer,\n",
    "we recommend [miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main)\n",
    "(but this tutorial assumes you already have access to conda).\n",
    "We also recommend installing `mamba`,\n",
    "which is basically a parallelized version of `conda`\n",
    "(and is part of the NCAR `conda` module).\n",
    "Instructions for installing CUPiD are available [on the CUPiD website](https://ncar.github.io/CUPiD/#installing),\n",
    "but we will cover the key steps here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1: Clone the repository from github\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the following command will create a subdirectory named `CUPiD` in your current working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/NCAR/CUPiD.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this tutorial will refer to the location you installed CUPiD as `${CUPID_ROOT}`.\n",
    "To be able to copy and paste blocks of commands directly,\n",
    "so let's add the variable to your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of you are using `bash` or `zsh`,\n",
    "which have been the default shell on Linux and Unix computers for a while now.\n",
    "To set the environment variable run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd CUPiD\n",
    "export CUPID_ROOT=`pwd -P`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have changed your shell to `csh` or `tcsh`,\n",
    "you will want to run the following instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd CUPiD\n",
    "setenv CUPID_ROOT `pwd -P`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not know for a fact that you changed your shell,\n",
    "you can probably assume you are using `bash`.\n",
    "To know for sure, though, run\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "echo $SHELL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2: Install two conda environments\n",
    "\n",
    "CUPiD needs a python environment with specific packages installed to run the CUPiD tools,\n",
    "while the diagnostic notebooks provided with CUPiD need a different set of packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run CUPiD itself we use the `(cupid-infrastructure)` environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ${CUPID_ROOT}\n",
    "mamba env create -f environments/cupid-infrastructure.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This step may take a while.\n",
    "When it completes you can verify it was successful by running\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate cupid-infrastructure\n",
    "which cupid-diagnostics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the environment installed correctly,\n",
    "`which` will return a path to `cupid-diagnostics`.\n",
    "If the environment did not install correctly,\n",
    "`which` will return an error like `which: no cupid-diagnostics in [long list of directories]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other environment provided by CUPiD is `(cupid-analysis)`.\n",
    "It can be installed by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mamba env create -f environments/cupid-analysis.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
