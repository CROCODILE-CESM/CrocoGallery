# Running a CUPiD Example

CUPiD provides examples of configuration files to allow users to look at a variety of diagnostics.
These examples are designed to be run on the NCAR supercomputers,
using output curated from CESM development runs and stored in `/glade/campaign/cesm/development/cross-wg/diagnostic_framework/CESM_output_for_testing/`. 
These example configuration files also act as templates for the CESM workflow discussed in the next section.

We have added a `regional_mom6` example to CUPiD that provides diagnostics for a 10-month run.
This run uses a 1/12Â° grid over the northwest Atlantic domain, and includes ocean biogeochemistry tracers from the Marine Biogeochemistry library (MARBL).
The compset used for this run was

```
1850_DATM%JRA_SLND_SICE_MOM6%MARBL-BIO_SROF_SGLC_SWAV_SESP
```
