# Running a CUPiD Example

CUPiD provides examples of configuration files to allow users to look at a variety of diagnostics in `CUPiD/examples`.
These examples are designed to be run on the NCAR supercomputers,
using output curated from CESM development runs and stored in `/glade/campaign/cesm/development/cross-wg/diagnostic_framework/CESM_output_for_testing/`. 
These example configuration files also act as templates for the CESM workflow discussed in the next section.

> **Note:** we actually access the example output through the CROCODILE workshop directory for simplicity: `/glade/campaign/cgd/oce/projects/CROCODILE/workshops/2025/Diagnostics/CESM_Output/`.
> It just links back to `CESM_output_for_testing`.

We have added a `regional_mom6` example to CUPiD that provides diagnostics for a 10-month run.
This run uses a 1/12Â° grid over the northwest Atlantic domain, and includes ocean biogeochemistry tracers from the Marine Biogeochemistry library (MARBL).
The compset used for this run was

```
1850_DATM%JRA_SLND_SICE_MOM6%MARBL-BIO_SROF_SGLC_SWAV_SESP
```

We will run the `regional_ocean` example included with CUPiD. This includes four notebooks:
- `Regional_Ocean_Report_Card.ipynb`: basic plotting and analysis utilities, primarily focused on surface fields.
- `Regional_Ocean_Animations.ipynb`: create animations.
- `Regional_Ocean_Atmospheric_Forcing.ipynb`: look at atmospheric forcing at the surface.
- `Regional_Ocean_OBC.ipynb`: visualize surface fields and open boundary conditions.

<h4 style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0; display: inline-flex; color: #5C0029;"> <strong> Checkpoint! </strong> </h4> 

Make sure `(cupid-infrastructure)` and `(cupid-analysis)` conda environments are fully installed before starting this task. If you are unsure, try running `conda activate cupid-infrastructure` and `conda activate cupid-analysis` in the terminal.

Let us know if you're running into any issues!
</div>

## Task 2: Let's Run CUPiD
Navigate to your installation of CUPiD, we will run the diagnostics in the example directory. 

```bash
cd ${CUPID_ROOT}
```

Now change to the `examples` directory, and look at what's inside.
```bash
cd examples
ls
```
<div class="alert alert-warning">  
<details>  

<summary>Output</summary><br>

```bash
additional_metrics  external_diag_packages  key_metrics  regional_ocean
```
</div>

We will be using the `regional_ocean` example for this demo and the workshop; if this example is not in your `examples` directory, let us know. 
Change into the `regional_ocean` directory. 
```bash
cd regional_ocean
```
For a standalone CUPiD run (i.e. not part of a CESM case run) we will run `cupid-diagnostics` from the same directory as a `config.yml` file. 
CUPiD will automatically recognize the file is in the current directory, and the output will also be in the same directory. Each example has a specific `config.yml`, let's look at the one in `regional_ocean`.

### Task 2.1: Peak at the `config.yml`
There are multiple tools that you can use to view files in JupyterHub and Linux, we recommend using `cat` or `less` from the terminal, or opening it directly in JupyterLab. 
You can also view this config file [here](https://gist.github.com/AidanJanney/92e34fdae16bf993a57fac7112ab818c) (it may be outdated). 

Most of the settings in `config.yml` stay the same or similar from the other examples, but there are a few key changes to note.

#### Global Params
![Regional Ocean Global Params](../../images/CUPiD/standalone_global_params.png)
Here is where we specify that CUPiD should run diagnostics on the example output discussed above. 

<div class="alert alert-warning">  
<details>  

<summary>Want to generate timeseries?</summary><br>

Note that the timeseries output directory `ts_dir` is not instantiated. 
You are able to create timeseries files, but you are not able to save them to the `CESM_output_dir` as you normally would because we only have read permissions there. 

If you want to run the timeseries tool, set `ts_dir: /glade/derecho/scratch/USERNAME/archive` or another directory 
(you can check what your username is with `echo ${USER}` in the terminal).

**Not recommended this for this example; it contains multiple terabytes of output.**
</div>

#### Notebook Parameters
![Regional Ocean Notebook Params](../../images/CUPiD/standalone_nb_params.png)
Here we pass in the specific variables for each notebook. Read more about specific variables in each notebook. The `mom6_input_dir` let's us access the input boundary conditions, the CESM workflow will handle this automatically.

This section also tells us this example will run four notebooks: 
`Regional_Ocean_Animations.ipynb`,
`Regional_Ocean_Atmospheric_Forcing.ipynb`,
`Regional_Ocean_OBC.ipynb`, and
`Regional_Ocean_Report_Card.ipynb`.

### Time to Run CUPiD!
Now we understand the processes and notebooks will run, it is time to run CUPiD. From the same `${CUPID_ROOT}/examples/regional_ocean` directory, run on one processor with:
```bash
cupid-diagnostics --serial
```
This step might take some time, and we can track the progress with the output to terminal.

The notebooks will be run in `nblibrary` and then copied to the current directory under `computed_notebooks/ocn`. If you want to rerun the notebooks, make sure to manually copy the `regional_utils.py` file with
```bash
cp ../../nblibrary/ocn/regional_utils.py computed_notebooks/ocn/
```

## Optional Task 2.2: CUPiD Webpage
We recommend viewing at the notebooks in JupyterHub and rerunning them in JupyterHub if you want to play with the output. 

If you want to use CUPiD's webpage feature, in the same directory, `${CUPID_ROOT}/examples/regional_ocean`, run:
```bash
cupid-webpage
```
