# ![CUPiD Logo](../../images/CUPiD/logo.png) Advanced CUPiD Tutorial ![CUPiD Logo](../../images/CUPiD/logo.png)

We walked through CUPiD basics and how to use it to analyze specific curated examples.
It can also be used to [analyze CESM runs](CUPiD_in_CESM_Workflow) directly from the case directory,
and you can create your own notebooks to run via CUPiD.
If you do that, you can also [share those notebooks with the community](contributing_to_CUPiD).
